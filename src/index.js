// THIS COMPONENT IS A FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT > IT IS GOOD FOR SIMPLE CONTENT WITH NO OR FEW LOGIC, BUT
// CLASS COMPONENTS IS GOOD FOR EVERYTHING ELSE !!!
// 2 TYPES OF COMPONENTS : FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS AND CLASS COMPONENTS
// CLASS COMPONENTS CAN USE STATE , FUNCTIONNAL COMPONENTS NO
// CLASS COMPONENTS PROVIDES EASIER CODE ORGANIZATION AND IT IS EASIER TO DO THINGS
// WHEN THE APP FIRST STARTS ( LIFECYCLE EVENTS)

// Props = 2 steps process : 1) Provide some details or informations to a child 2Â°) We consume the information

// Props system is all about having a parent customize how the child looks or behaves !!!
// The goal of a Prop is to customize or configure a child component
//CommentDetail is considered as a CHILD COMPONENT of APP Component !!!!

// to nest our new component inside our first component , we dont use curly braces
// like always , cause when you
// include a component
// inside jsx , we dont have to put curly braces , but just a closing tag and inside
// the name of our component

// How to reuse or duplicate a component ?
// Steps : Identify the JSX that appears to be duplicated
// Whats the purpose of that block of JSX ? in our case , the purpose is to display a single comment/ comment details
// Create a new file to house this new component , it should have the same name that the component
// => so we create a CommentDetail.js in SRC , Aand we import react from react and also faker

// create a new component in the new file , paste the JSX into it => we create a CommentDetail function
// and paste all the code from our index.js corresponding to the element that we want to duplicate

// Make the new component configurable by using reacts 'props' system
